## What Kaulby Does

You're building a product. People are talking about it (or your competitors) right now on Reddit, Hacker News, and dozens of other communities. Kaulby finds those conversations automatically and tells you what matters.

- **Monitor 17 platforms** — Reddit, Hacker News, Product Hunt, Dev.to, GitHub, YouTube, Trustpilot, G2, App Store, Play Store, Quora, X/Twitter, Google Reviews, Yelp, Amazon Reviews, Indie Hackers, Hashnode
- **AI-powered analysis** — Sentiment detection, pain point extraction, lead scoring, and categorization that actually understands context
- **Real-time alerts** — Email, Slack, Discord, webhooks, and in-app notifications when someone mentions your brand
- **Smart digests** — Daily, weekly, or monthly email summaries with AI-generated insights so you don't have to check constantly
- **HubSpot CRM sync** — Automatically push high-scoring leads to your CRM
- **Team workspaces** — Role-based access, shared monitors, collaborative workflows
